## Description

This simple web application allows users to keep track of animals at a zoo! The user can log newly admitted animals by navigating to a form and adding their species, name, age, diet, zoo location, number of needed caretakers, sex, likes, and dislikes. The user can also view lists of logged animals including all animals, and also filtered lists displaying just young animals (less than two years of age) and mature animals (two years of age or older). The user can also navigate to an edit page for each animal where they can update information as they see fit.
